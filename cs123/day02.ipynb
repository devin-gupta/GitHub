    "\n",
    "Today we're dealing with forward kinematics, here are some interesting notes. \n",

    "#### Kinematics\n",
    "- Pupper is technically has 18 degrees of freedom, 12 for each leg and 3 motors, and then an additional 6. \n",
    "- Forward Kinematics is entirely determined -> getting end affector positions from pose, $q \\rightarrow x$\n",
    "- Inverse Kinematics is undetermined -> getting pose from end affector positions, $x \\rightarrow q$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coordinate Frame\n",
    "- Start with world coordinate (absolute positon) and then define a particular position\n",
    "- From there define a local coordinate system through each transformation axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a translation matrix and a rotation matrix can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Translation Matrix:**\n",
    "A translation matrix moves a point from one location to another in a 3D space. For a translation by $(tx, ty, tz)$, the matrix is:\n",

    "T = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 0 & 0 & tx \\\\\n",

    "0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rotation Matrix:**\n",
    "A rotation matrix rotates a point around an axis. For a rotation by angle $\\theta$ around the z-axis, the matrix is:\n",
