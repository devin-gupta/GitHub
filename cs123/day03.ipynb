    "- Note that simplicity, we suggest that $ T_{0 \\rightarrow 1} R_0 = F_{01} $.\n",

    "- 3 types of joints, 1-DOF joints, 2-DOF joints and 3-DOF joints. Pupper only uses 1-DOF for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formulate IK problem\n",
    "- Ask - what is the condition for a pose such that the toe reaches point $p$. This is forumated as $ C(q) = p(q) - \\bar{p} = 0 $\n",
    "- Now plug in $p(q)$ and you recover an optimization problem, specifically when $C(q)$ is non linear or if there are multiple solutions.\n",

    "#### Solve IK via Optimization\n",
    "$$ \\text{min } || C(q) ^2 || $$\n",
    "- To solve this, we use gradient descent.\n"
