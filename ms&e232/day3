Dominant Strategies
- strategy a is weakly dominant if
- s = [s1, s2, ...] basically the vector of s that represents the chosen strategies of every player
- s -i = behavior of all other players than i. 
- strict dominance --> b is always better than a, no matter what other players do. 

Dominant Strategy
- strategy b is weakly dominant if it weakly dominates every other strategy a in the strategy space. 
- strategy b is strictly dominant if it strictly dominates every other strategy a in the strategy space. 
- in prisoner's dilemma, strategy b is a strict dominant strategy.

Second Price Auction Theory (Vickery Auction)
- N bidders, each bidder i has value vi for item.
- if your bid wins, payoff is vi - S(i-1). if you lose, payoff is 0. 
- went through modeling and proving "strategy dominant to bid value". didn't consider tie breaking scenarios. 

terms: auction theory, market design, mechnanism design, inverse game theory

Questions: 
- what is time complexity of evaluating player a choosing any real, and player b choosing any real?
