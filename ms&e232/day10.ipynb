    "PunishDefection strategy ensures that both players cooperate due to a credible threat of much worse nash equilibrium.\n",
    "This relies on some \"caring about the future\" which is modeled by an infinite game with a relevant discount factor. \n",

    "Consider RewardCooperation: \n",
    "- I initially play \"defect\". \n",
    "- If either player cooperates, both players then cooperate forever. \n",

    "Set up trigger strategies as SPNE for general games: \n",
    "(1) Every player commits to <b>a</b> instead of <b>a</b><sub>NE</sub>. But if anyone plays anything other than <b>a</b> then everyone will then play <b>a</b><sub>NE</sub> forever. \n",
    "(2) We can prove there will always be some $\\delta$ or discount factor such that the trigger strategy is an SPNE. \n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION: has there been research into making friends and being nice initially? If corporate context where I won't see people again, $\\delta$ might be low and hence its harder to start trusting and make friends. Versus if $\\delta$ is large (new team or university), we ensure people trust initially and hence induce cooperation-cooperation strategies.\n",
