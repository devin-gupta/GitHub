    "#### Optimization / Finding Nash Equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main approaches\n",
    "1. compute the best response mappings for every player -> any intersection between the best response mappings is a pure NE. \n",
    "2. \"Guess\": Fix a strategy profile and check is any player benefits from deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence 1) nash equilibria are hard to find, especially if you're the one designing the game. And 2) \n",
    "\n",
    "How do players choose to play NE? \n",
    "1. A third party recommends each player to player their best strategy and each player agrees and does so. Ex. Ebay suggesting just bid your value. \n",
    "2. Each player believes other players will play s<sub>-i</sub> and hence they play s<sub>i</sub>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Routing Games\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a potential function: \n",
    "\n",
    "V(s) = $\\sum$ (z(s))\n",
    "where z represents the delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "In network routing games, best response dynamics converge to NE. Not true for general games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we played the same game as Day 3:\n"
