# ðŸŽ“ Stanford Class Notes ðŸ“š

This repository contains my class notes from my time at Stanford University. The notes are organized by class and are intended to be used with a visual format for better understanding.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure and ðŸš€ Getting Started

The repository is organized by class. Each class has its own folder, and within each folder, you'll find the relevant notes and resources. To get started, simply navigate to the class folder you're interested in and open the notes in your preferred markdown viewer.

## ðŸ“š Classes

Here's a list of the classes included in this repository:

- CS 109 - Probability for Computer Scientists. I self-studied this and wanted a diligent way to take notes.
- CS 161 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Github provided easy implementation and testing of algorithmic complexity. Limited notes here.
- MS&E 232 - Introduction to Game Theory. Was an amazing exploration and visualization of complex games. Highly suggest!
- PHYSICS 113 - Computational Physics. One of my favorite classes at Stanford with amazing visualizations of neat maths!

Feel free to explore and happy studying! ðŸŽ‰
